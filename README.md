The purpose of this project is to collect, process,  clean , and produce tidy data that can be used forfuture analysis. 
The Goal is to create a final script, "run_analysis.r", that could perform the following process:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject.

In this project i will produce:
1. a tidy data set, 
2. a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
3. a code book ,"CodeBook.md" , that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or 
work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4. README.md file.
